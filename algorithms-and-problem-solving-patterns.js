// Section 4-19. 문제 해결법 소개

// Objectoves
// - Define what an algorithm is
// - Devise a plan to solve algorithms
// - Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

// What is an algorithm?
// A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

// What do I need to know this?
// Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm!
// It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer Also Interviews

// How do you improve?
// 1. Devise a plan for solving problems
// 2. Master common problem solving patterns

// Problem solving
// - Understand the problem
// - Explore Concrete Examples
// - Break It Down
// - Solve/Simplify
// - Look Back and Refactor
